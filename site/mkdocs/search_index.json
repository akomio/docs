For example collect user personal details, make a booking or perform a search. You can create as many flows for your bot. The first defined flow is considered to be an entry point flow and is executed when user starts new conversation with your bot. Flow consists of one or more steps.\n\n\nStep\n is a building block of your bot. It describes specific user interaction with your bot like display text, buttons, ask for a number, date etc. There are multiple possible types of steps that are described below.\n\n\nText Step\n\n\nActions Step\n\n\nCards Step\n\n\nInput Step\n\n\nText\n\n\nDate\n\n\nTime\n\n\nNumber\n\n\nRemote Step",
